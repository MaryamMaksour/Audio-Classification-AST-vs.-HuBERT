# Audio-Classification-AST-vs.-HuBERT

This project compares the performance of **Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST)** and **HuBERT** on the Speech Commands dataset.
We evaluate the models based on key metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall.

  - **AST** outperforms **HuBERT** across all metrics, achieving higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    - While HuBERT is faster during evaluation, AST's use of Mel Spectrograms enables better overall performance on the Speech Commands dataset.
